\section{Problem Statement}
The Customers Churn prediction is an effective measure and research topic for the Telecom Industry as retaining the existing customers is easier then acquiring new ones. The acquisition of new customers involve considerable amount of resources, while retaining existing customers is cost effective and an optimized option for the industries to look upon parameters that can favour both the sides and create improvents in the customers satisfication. This project aims to look into the parameters that can effect the Churning out of customers with Machine Learning algorithms and a detailed analysis on the various important parameters that involves the Customers Churning and their behaviour.

\section{Data}
Data is described upon parameters such as the geographical location, various charges involved, plans provided and the number of customer service calls  that decide upon the Churning. The table represents a sample of various fields available in the data.

\subsection{Visualizations}
We tried to plot the number of customers by the state. The heatmap Fig:\ref{fig:1.1} represents the number of customers per state

\caption{Customers Heatmap}
\label{fig:1.2}
\end{figure}
There are numerous customer in the North Eastern State of West Virgina and the least customers index being California.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
All Machine Learning Algorithms take the data in a Guassian/Normal distribution for better prediction, accuracy and less variance among features. Eventhough, the most of the features are normally distributed we have scaled all the features for feeding data into model. The scaled data can be as shown

\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Preprocessing}
Data Exploration is an essential part of every Data Science project. The obtained data may not be always in the required form to perform any analysis or get insights. Most of the machine learining algorithms requires the data to be cleaned, processed or scaled to train a model on it. These techniques are easy to understand but every dataset is different and has a unique challenge in it.
\subsection{Outlier Analysis}

The shown boxplot Fig: \ref{fig:2.1} refers outliers on the predictors variables, we can see various outliers associated with the features. Eventhough, the data has considerale amount of outliers, the approach is to retain every outlier and grab respective behaviour of all customers. As shown there are significant amount of outliers present in the amount of night calls, which indicates a trend on customers' behaviour, there can be normal customers with an average usage appearing within the inter quartile, as well as customers who have business type accounts may have heavy usage and they appear above the quartile which seems important and can be concluded that Outliers here have information and retaining them would have advantage over the analysis.

\subsection{Feature Engineering}

Feature Engineering is described as the knowledge extraction process, where important features are selected using domain knowledge to make a machine learning algorithm work. There can be features that aren't relevant for the analysis, we can remove such variables using numerous ways. However, we considered taking correlation on the variables and make a heatmap Fig: \ref{fig:2.2} to check relationships among the features and then dropping redundant variables. 
\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:2.2}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Feature Selection}
The Bi-Variate analysis in Fig: \ref{fig:2.3} shows International Plan, Total Day Minutes, Number of Customer Service Call are related with Churn which is shown in the Linear Plot

\label{fig:2.3}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
The variables Number of Vmail Messages, Total Day Charge,Total Eve Charge,Total Night Charge,Total Intl Charge are dropped from the analysis as they are highly correlated with other variables.
The final variables selected for the analysis are Fig: \ref{fig:2.4}.

\chapter{Modeling}
\section{Ensemble Technique}
The goal of any machine learning problem is to find a single model that will best predict our wanted outcome. Rather than making one model and hoping this model is the best/most accurate predictor we can make, ensemble methods take a myriad of models into account, and average those models to select one final model. Our approach is to consider the classification models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and The Random Forest model to obtain all the accuracies and then select a model that has a better Accuracy, Precision and Recall for a binomial prediction of whether or not a Customer will Churn. We used an iterative approach to test upon the above models and then plotted the results with accuracy,precision and recall respectively. The results from the model can be as shown,
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imb_model_results1.PNG}
     \caption{Model Results 3/4}

    \caption{Model Results 1/4}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The results shows a good accuracy however the recall for these models are not acceptable as  we are more focused on the churning ratio and if the models predicts recall of 74\% for Decision Tree, 27\% for K-Nearest Neighbors, 18\% for Logistic Regression and 68\% for Random Forest Model. Which are relatively less and leads to the Type I Error which means the model gives irrelavant measure  in predicting that customers' churn however they don't  i.e; a minimum accuracy in predicting the False Positive Rate. The given ROC depicts the Area Under Curve for different models. All models didn't perform well and hence they fail to  give a better AUC.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{-5pt}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{Imb_ROC.PNG}
\caption{Initial ROC plot}
\label{fig:3.3}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
Upon Re-Analysing we see that, the dataset is more biased towards the Customers who didn't Churned out then who did. Which leads to Target Class Imbalance in the dataset.
\section{Target Class Imbalance}
It is the problem in machine learning where the total number of a class of data (positive) is far less than the total number of another class of data (negative). This problem is extremely common in practice and can be observed in various disciplines.\\
Most machine learning algorithms and works best when the number of instances of each classes are roughly equal. When the number of instances of one class far exceeds the other, problems arise. This is best illustrated with our current situation.\\
In our dataset of Churn ratio, we would like to find out which are Customers that churned and who didn't. Now, it is highly cost effective for telecom company if a trusted customers churns, and costs a loss of a valuable customer. We want to catch as many cases of TRUE churning as possible and then optimize the parameters to reduce the TRUE churning ratio.\\
The imbalanced ratio as shown 
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{Target_imb.PNG}
\caption{Target Class Imbalance}
\label{fig:3.4}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
\section{SMOTE for Reducing Imbalance}
Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) is a technique which resamples the minority samples by selecting k nearest minority samples  and then creating a synthetic sample which equals to the average between two samples,  it's better option then replicating minority samples.\\
We will apply this sampling approach and check every models' performance. The R and Python implementations are as shown
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Python SMOTE Implementation]
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
sm = SMOTE(random_state = 101)
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_sample(X, y)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_res, y_res, test_size=0.3, random_state=101) 
\end{lstlisting}
\FloatBarrier
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R, caption=R resampling]
#Creating over,under,both and synthetic samples to overcome target imbalance
cdf_over = ovun.sample(Churn ~., data = cdf_train, method = 'over',N = 5984)$data
cdf_under = ovun.sample(Churn ~., data = cdf_train, method = 'under',N = 1004)$data
cdf_both = ovun.sample(Churn ~., data = cdf_train, method = 'both',
                       p = 0.5,
                       seed = 221,
                       N = 3494)$data

cdf_ROSE = ROSE(Churn ~., data = cdf_train,
                N = 5000,
                seed = 221)$data
\end{lstlisting}
After Resampling the data we see that there is an equal distribution for both the categories in the response variable.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{5pt}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{balanced.PNG}
\caption{Balanced resampled data}
\label{fig:3.5}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
\section{Re-modeling with Balanced Set}
After resampling using the Synthetic Method the models are trained with the a balanced target class and hence the obatined ROC is as shown, which shows better AUC and the models perform well in determining the Recall and the Precision alongwith a better Accuracy. The RF model again shows  a better accuracy of 97\% while Logistic model with an acuuracy of 79\% being the least. The Receiver Operator Curve for these models is as shown \\
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\vspace{-100pt}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{Balanced_ROC.PNG}
\caption{ROC on Balanced Data}
\label{fig:3.6}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
The shown ROC curve depicts better performance with a balanced dataset. There is significant difference in both the ROC curve and we can conclude that Target Class Imbalance has made the model to perform with a better Recall and hence the aim of Reducing the Churn with a decent Recall solves the issue.
